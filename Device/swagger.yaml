    An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a
    particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.). A Device is a
    tangible object which contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of
    data. A Device is always assumed to be capable of communicating electronically
    via a network.

    This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
    operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/).

    This data model reuses concepts coming from the
    [SAREF Ontology](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/01.01.01_60/ts_103264v010101p.pdf)
    part of [ETSI](http://www.etsi.org) standards.
